# Pan_Bacterial_Research_Panel

- Healthcare Acquired infections (HAIs) are one of the largest causes of mortality.

- The Ion AmpliSeq Pan-Bacterial Research Panel is a quick, accurate and cost-effective tool to detect bacterial organisms at genus and species level and detect with 31 different antibiotic classes.

- The panel contains 2 pools:
	- the first containing **`269 amplicons to detect 21 specific species`** and 716 amplicons to assess the presence of 364 antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes.
	- the second containing 24 amplicons for 16S profiling of up to approximately 400,000 16S sequences in public Greengenes database.
	- AMR content has been developed in Collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.

- To analyze the sequencing output from this panel, a Torrent Suite plugin under the name “PanBacterialAnalysis” is available on the ThermoFisher Scientific Plugin store.

### Notes
In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family.

family > genus > species

科 > 属 > 种



### Taxonomic rank
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank#Examples

For `Human`, genus level is `Homo`, and species level is `H. sapiens`.

For `E. coli`, genus level is `Escherichia`, and species level is `E. coli`.

>Escherichia is a genus of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae.

>Escherichia是来自肠杆菌科的革兰氏阴性、非孢子形成、兼性厌氧杆状细菌属。

### Homo

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo
Homo (from Latin homō 'man') is the genus that emerged in the (otherwise extinct) genus Australopithecus that encompasses the extant species Homo sapiens (modern humans), plus several extinct species classified as either ancestral to or closely related to modern humans (depending on the species), most notably Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis. The genus emerged with the appearance of Homo habilis just over 2 million years ago.[a] Homo, together with the genus Paranthropus, is probably sister to Australopithecus africanus, which itself had previously split from the lineage of Pan, the chimpanzees.



### H. sapiens

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human

Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study.
