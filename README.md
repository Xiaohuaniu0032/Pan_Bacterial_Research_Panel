# Pan_Bacterial_Research_Panel

- Healthcare Acquired infections (HAIs) are one of the largest causes of mortality.

- The Ion AmpliSeq Pan-Bacterial Research Panel is a quick, accurate and cost-effective tool to detect bacterial organisms at genus and species level and detect with 31 different antibiotic classes.

- The panel contains 2 pools:
	- the first containing **`269 amplicons to detect 21 specific species`** and 716 amplicons to assess the presence of 364 antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes.
	- the second containing 24 amplicons for 16S profiling of up to approximately 400,000 16S sequences in public Greengenes database.
	- AMR content has been developed in Collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.

- To analyze the sequencing output from this panel, a Torrent Suite plugin under the name “PanBacterialAnalysis” is available on the ThermoFisher Scientific Plugin store.
